<h1>The Best Movies According to Hayden</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Mid 90's</h3>
<p>What I like so much about this movie is that it was made in 2018, yet it captures the looks and the feel of the 1990's, even going as far as using recording quality that is far lesser thn what we see today.</p>
<h3>The Wolf of Wallstreet</h3>
<p>I like how this movie shows what money can do to people and just how much of an influence the people around you can have.</p>
<h3>McFarland</h3>
<p>This was one of my favorites a while back because it shows how sometimes the thing you need most in life, is the thing you expect the least.</p>
