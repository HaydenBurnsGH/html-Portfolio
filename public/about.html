<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Hayden, and I am beginning my web development journey at 19 years old. 
</p>

<p>One fact about me is that I know I want something more out of my life than to just work a 9-5 and barely get by.
<p>This is my first time building my own website and I am excited to see what improvements I can make as I go along in the course!</p>
